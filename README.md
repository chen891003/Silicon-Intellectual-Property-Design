# Silicon-Intellectual-Property-Design

**This repository documents my learning materials for the Silicon Intellectual Property Design course.
It includes design .v files, testbenches, makefiles, and assignment presentations.**

## The circuit project assigned in this course is a floating-point calculator.
**It provides hands-on experience with the front-end cell-based design flow, culminating in the completion of an IP.**
